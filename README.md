## Challenge

1. Add a score label that updates as the playerâ€™s score changes.
2. Make the game end after a certain number of launches. You will need to use the invalidate() method of Timer to stop it from repeating.
3. Use the waitForDuration and removeFromParent actions in a sequence to make sure explosion particle emitters are removed from the game scene when they are finished.
